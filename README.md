# 🚀 OmniBot (WIP)

A web app that allows users to send the same prompt to multiple AI models simultaneously and compare responses.

## ✨ Features

- 🛠 **Customizable Queries**: Users can select/deselect AI models per query.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express

- **ChatGPT** – Assisted in outlining the project, providing prompts, and generating documentation  
- **Lovable** – Streamlined front-end component generation and UI structuring  
- **GitHub Copilot** – Facilitated code integration, debugging, and cross-file implementations
